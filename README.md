# Satellite Tracker v1

**Satellite Tracker** is a Python application that allows you to track satellites in real time with a radar-style animated terminal interface!

The project uses the [N2YO API](https://www.n2yo.com/api/) to fetch satellite data, and libraries like `rich`, `requests`, and `plyer` to create an interactive experience with local notifications.

## Features

- Choose a custom location for satellite observation.
- Display an animated ASCII radar in the terminal.
- List available satellite categories.
- Show visible satellites based on location and category.
- Track specific satellites and receive notifications when they are approaching.

## Installation

You can install the requirements using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

## How to use

Run this command in your teminal (inside the folder):

```bash
python main.py
```
